# Design and UX

If you have any visual or user experience design skills to contribute, we would
be dlighted to hear from you.

The design of the default theme originally evolved from Croydon Council, which
took strong influence from Brighton and Hove City COuncil and of course, Gov.uk
and GDS.

We now need more evidence based design based on best practice and existing user
research, as well as new ideas that we can test with further user research.

If you have any skills to contrubute, please get in touch.
