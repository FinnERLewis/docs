# Testing

We welcome anybody to report issues with any projects in the [LocalGovDrupal](https://github.com/localgovdrupal) space, each repository might have its own rules for submitting issues.

## Contribution ideas

There's lots of areas of testing you can help out with, many of which are not
too technical. Some ideas are below:

* Test the etting started documentation, does it make sense?

* Accessibility testing the admin and frontend themes

* Unit testing for custom modules and Drupal configuration by LocalGov

* Testing open pull requests

* Reproducing reported issues by other users

* Extending the existing suite of automated tests

* Performance and compatibility testing
