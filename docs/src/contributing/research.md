# User research and user testing

We want to make evidence based decisions on information architecture, content
strategy, visual design, interaction design and content management
functionality. To do this we need user research to uncover needs and problems of
people who might interact with a council website and then user testing to build
an evidance base for the decisions we make.

If you are able to contribute user resarch or user testing resources, please get
in touch.
