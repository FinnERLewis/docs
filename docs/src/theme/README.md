# Frontend theme

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_theme)

The theme uses Bootstrap 4 out of the box and is compiled using Gulp 4 for compiling SASS to CSS. We aim for each library to be included and compiled separately so that subthemes can selectively override each library they don't wish to inherit.

## Admin theme

We also have an admin theme that comes with some enhancements to the Claro theme found in core. You can read more about it in its [documentation](/theme/admin-theme).
